{"id":"furman-2f5","title":"Add drag-and-drop support for file uploads and downloads","description":"Implement drag-and-drop file transfer between the OS file manager (Finder) and Furman's S3 panel. This is table-stakes UX that every major S3 client (Cyberduck, S3 Browser, Transmit, CloudBerry, WinSCP) supports.\n\n## Scope\n\n- Drag from Finder to S3 panel: Upload files/folders to the current S3 prefix\n- Drag from S3 panel to Finder: Download files/folders to the drop target\n- Drag between panels: If both panels are S3, perform server-side copy; if one is local, upload/download accordingly\n\n## Notes\n\n- Tauri supports drag-and-drop events via the window's onDragDropEvent or HTML5 drag/drop APIs\n- Should integrate with the existing transfer queue (multipart, pause/resume, bandwidth throttling)\n- Show visual drop target indicator when dragging over a valid panel","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"fenio@debian.org","created_at":"2026-02-26T12:58:32Z","created_by":"Bartosz Fenski","updated_at":"2026-02-26T12:58:32Z"}
{"id":"furman-4q1","title":"Add folder sync between local filesystem and S3","description":"Implement local-to-S3 and S3-to-local folder synchronization. This is a heavily requested feature in S3 clients -- Transmit, CloudBerry, and S3 Browser all offer it.\n\n## Scope\n- Local to S3 sync: Upload new/changed files from a local directory to an S3 prefix\n- S3 to Local sync: Download new/changed objects from an S3 prefix to a local directory\n- Comparison modes: Compare by size + last modified date; optionally by ETag/checksum\n- Preview mode: Show a diff/plan of what would be transferred before executing\n- Filters: Include/exclude patterns (e.g., ignore .DS_Store, node_modules/)\n- Delete handling: Option to delete files at destination that don't exist at source (with confirmation)\n\n## Notes\n- Should integrate with the existing transfer queue for actual file transfers\n- Consider a dry-run mode that shows what would change without transferring\n- Bidirectional sync is complex (conflict resolution) -- start with one-directional sync first\n- S3-to-S3 sync (between buckets/prefixes) would be a natural follow-up","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"fenio@debian.org","created_at":"2026-02-26T12:58:48Z","created_by":"Bartosz Fenski","updated_at":"2026-02-26T12:58:48Z"}
{"id":"furman-dba","title":"Add S3 Select support for in-place querying of CSV/JSON/Parquet","description":"Implement S3 Select to let users run SQL queries on CSV, JSON, and Parquet files directly in S3 without downloading them. No desktop S3 client currently offers this -- it would be a unique selling point for Furman.\n\n## Scope\n- Query UI: SQL editor with syntax highlighting for writing SELECT queries\n- Input format configuration: CSV (delimiter, header row, comments), JSON (document vs. lines), Parquet\n- Output format: Display results in a table view; option to export as CSV/JSON\n- Compression support: GZIP, BZIP2, and uncompressed input\n- Progress reporting: S3 Select provides progress events -- show bytes scanned/processed\n\n## Backend\n- New Tauri command: s3_select_object_content\n- Uses SelectObjectContent API with InputSerialization, OutputSerialization, and Expression\n- Stream results back to frontend via Tauri events\n\n## Example Use Cases\n- Query a 10GB CSV log file for specific error codes without downloading\n- Extract specific fields from large JSON datasets\n- Preview Parquet data without any local tooling\n\n## Notes\n- S3 Select has a 256KB output limit per record\n- Not supported on Glacier/Deep Archive storage classes\n- Works on individual objects only (not across multiple files)\n- Consider offering query templates for common operations (COUNT, WHERE, LIMIT)","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"fenio@debian.org","created_at":"2026-02-26T12:58:57Z","created_by":"Bartosz Fenski","updated_at":"2026-02-26T12:58:57Z"}
